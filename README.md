# Oasis-Infobyte Internship Repository

This repository is created for the Oasis Infobyte online internship program. It contains the tasks assigned during the internship, organized into different folders.

## Task 2: Number Guessing Game

Inside the "TASK 2" folder, you will find a Java file named `GuessTheNumber.java`. This file contains the code for a number guessing game. The game logic is implemented in Java, providing an interactive and enjoyable experience.

## Task 3: ATM Interface

Inside the "TASK 3" folder, you will find three files:

- `AtmInterface.java`: This file contains the source code for an ATM interface.
- `AtmInterface.class`: The compiled Java class file for the ATM interface.
- `BankAccount.class`: The compiled Java class file for the Bank Account used in the ATM demo.

These files collectively demonstrate a simple ATM interface and associated bank account functionality.

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for your understanding and learning.
